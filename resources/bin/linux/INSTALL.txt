WhisperDictation Linux Setup Instructions

1. Make the setup script executable:
   chmod +x setup-sox.sh

2. Run the setup script:
   ./setup-sox.sh

The script will:
- Install SoX if not already installed
- Set up necessary audio permissions
- Add your user to required groups

If you prefer manual installation:

Ubuntu/Debian:
    sudo apt-get install sox

Fedora:
    sudo dnf install sox

Arch Linux:
    sudo pacman -S sox

After installation, ensure your user has proper audio permissions:
    sudo usermod -a -G audio,pulse-access 

NOTE: You may need to log out and back in for group changes to take effect.
